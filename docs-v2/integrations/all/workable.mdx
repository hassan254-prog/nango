## Getting started

Workable offers API keys ("API access token"), partner tokens, and OAuth for authentication. Nango currently only supports API-key-based authentication.

## Connection configuration in Nango

Workable requires a user specific subdomain for the API base URL.

You should request this from the user and pass it to Nango in the `nango.auth()` call:

```js
nango.auth('workable', '<CONNECTION-ID>', {params: {subdomain: '<workable-subdomain>'}});
```

For more details see the [docs here](/integrate/guides/authorize-an-api#apis-requiring-connection-specific-configuration-for-authorization).

## API gotchas

- To authorize a Workable Connection in Nango you need to pass both the API key and the company's workable subdomain:
```js
nango.auth('workable', '<CONNECTION-ID>', {
        credentials: {
            apiKey: '<END-USER-API-KEY>'
        },
        params: {
            subdomain: '<WORKABLE-SUBDOMAIN>'
        }});
```

- The API base URL in Nango is set to `https://{subdomain}.workable.com` for future forward compatability. To call endpoints of the V3 API, prefix the endpoint with `/spi/v3/`, e.g. `/spi/v3/candidates`.
