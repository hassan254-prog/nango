## API gotchas

- When creating a new connection, `clientType` specifies the type of client by marketplace location. For the US marketplace, the clientType is `seller`. For other marketplace locations, such as Canada, it is `seller-ca`, and for Mexico, it is `seller-mx`.
- The `clientId` is the pre-registered identifier that uniquely identifies a solution provider app.
