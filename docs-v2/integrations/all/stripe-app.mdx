## Connection configuration in Nango for external test apps

If you are using the "External Test" version of your app, Stripe requires you to use a temporary id to identify your application. See the [docs](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-apps/api-authentication/oauth#install-app) for more information.

In this case, you must use the `stripe-app-sandbox` integration in Nango, and add the temporary ID to the `appDomain` field in the connection params.

```js
nango.auth('stripe-app-sandbox', '<CONNECTION-ID>', {params: {appDomain: '<stripe-app-domain>'}});
```
