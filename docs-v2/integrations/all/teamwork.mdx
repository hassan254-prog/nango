## API gotchas

-   There are no scopes needed in the authorization, hence, you can keep the scope field empty.
-   Teamwork utilizes [distinct subdomain extensions and site names](https://apidocs.teamwork.com/guides/teamwork/getting-started-with-the-teamwork-com-api#getting-your-url) tailored to different regions. For instance, European customers are assigned a subdomain with the `.eu` extension, such as `yourSiteName.eu`, whereas US-based clients are provided with a subdomain without any additional extension, like `yourSiteName`. Remember to use the appropriate subdomain for your specific region.
-   If you're using a custom domain, you can override the set `base_url` using `baseUrlOverride`.
